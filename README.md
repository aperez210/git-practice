# git-practice
This is a python program meant to experiment with midi sequencing. 
When this program is run, it will synthesize the first few measures of "Life Will Change" from the video game Persona 5.
It helped me practice reading, writing and overriding to files in Python along with practing sequencing midi with code (which is absolutely awful and do not reccomend)
